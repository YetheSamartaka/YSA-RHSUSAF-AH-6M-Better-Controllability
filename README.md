## INFORMATION
This small addon adjusts controllability of RHSUSAF AH-6M so it is not a "flying brick" but truly agile helicopter - just like in real life.
- BIKEY and BISIGN included

- ```maxSpeed=250; //Increased from 200 to 250 in order to allow higher speeds for the AI```
- ```liftForceCoef=1.7; //Increased from 1 to 1.7 in order to increase lift buoyancy(achieve faster lift)```
- ```cyclicAsideForceCoef=2; //Increased from 1.65 to 2 in order to increase the tilt sensitivity to the sides```
- ```cyclicForwardForceCoef=0.43; //Increased from 0.4 to 0.43 in order to increase the pull/push sensitivity```
- ```bodyFrictionCoef=0.2; //Decreased from 0.3 to 0.2 in order to lower the friction --> increase speed```
